## Latest Notice

* **Express Calc assign to F4/Ctrl+F4 button and no longer F5/Ctrl+F5**
* **In Markdown**
  * **When dragging curssor with mouse/trackpad on text**
    * **Markdown will wrapped the text when insert**
    * **Only for B, I, U, S, L, SP, and SB (Bold, Italic, Underline, Strikethrough, Link hypertext website, Superscript, and Subscript)**
      * **Add two more buttons M and SA (Marking highlight and Special Attribute)**

      # "p" for parent, "c<number>" for child, and "s" for space

      p:Parent input
      c1:Child input and <number> can up to 50
      s:

      # Result:

      Parent input:
          -Child input and <number> can up to 50

      ```

    * **For add-on TVG has another format please click -> [NEW](#new)**  
* **Send email (fn+F3 / Ctrl+F3)**
  * **For MacOs X**
    * **Enhance the text by converting emojies to text description**
    * **Using dependency: demoji**
      * **[@bsolomon1124](https://pypi.org/project/demoji/)**
* **Markdown has short-cut**
  * **Check it out in tutorial press `Ctrl+F1 / fn+F1`**
* **Filename enhancement**
  * **Abbriviation in uppercase will be kept unchange otherwise all will be title**
* **Fold selected enhancement**
  * **Will reload previous selections**
  * **Can click / "ctrl + s" Insight for identifying what to select**
  * **Use Shift-key for massive selection and Ctrl-key for select or unselect individually**
* **Fold enhancement**
  * **Unfolding no longer delete retain selected childs**
    * **If you press "Fold Childs" the retain ones will be folded again**
  * **Fold selected will delete the retain selected if selections is none**
  * **Fold Childs will fold all childs, if there is no retain selected**

* **EXPLANATION:**
  * **If user want to keep the selected fold and using hidden mode**
    * **Just unfold and use hidden mode**
    * **While in hidden mode, user could not use the fold function**
    * **If hidden mode is cleared, just press fold childs again and the retain ones will folded back again**
  * **For CPP function \[very powerful function for manipulating text content\]**
    * **In Hidden mode, you can select CPP to copied the text content and copied to new file or existing file**
* **In CPP function**
  * **CPP selection has been hacked for it's selection mode**
    * **By default is extended mode selection that works like charm, same as selection mode for Fold selected**
    * **However, if you find it confusing when you wanted choose the cells for manipulation, you can hacked the configuration to multiple mode**
      * **Multiple mode will choose the cells one by one selectively**

* **The algorithm of CPP has been improved**
  * **Now selections that is not in order can be copied and moved to chosen selected line number**

* ## **Technical issues on shortcut buttons**
  
  * **Due to some similarity of shortcut buttons in TVG with the global one in a OS, therefore the functions may result weirdly**
  * **Found issues:**
    * **TVG**
      * **<ins>Ctrl+n</ins> for <ins>CPP function</ins> in <ins>MacOS X</ins>**
      * **resulting selections being canceled and only one selected below selections**
      * **For reference research [Shortcuts in MacOS X](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236)**
    * **Resolution**
      * **Now change to <ins>Cmd+n</ins> for <ins>CPP function</ins> in <ins>MacOS X</ins>**

* **Selection preference**
  * **Configuring selection to "multiple" will also applied to Fold selected function**
  * **Only for Hidden mode will not change, as it is "multiple" by default**
    * **No point to change to other selection mode, because the function's selection only choosing parents**
* **Insight function**
  * **Now functioning in Hidden mode, and CPP as well**
* **In Hidden Mode**
  * **No longer 2 options**
  * **The hidden mode is using reverse option only**
    * **That mean the selection parents are not hid, and the rest will be hidden.**
  * **TAKE NOTICE:**
    * **If this changes bother any user, please stay with the current installed one**
    * **However any future update changes will no more 2 options as well for Hidden Mode**
    * **This decision deliberately done because of new functions Fold**
      * **In fold hiding selections are making more sense**
* **On 2nd thought**
  * **Is not easy to just hid 1 parent, so there is the configuration for it**
  * **Will change the reverse option in Hidden mode**
    * **The selections will be hidden instead**

* **Combobox algorithm enhance for selecting file or creating new file**
  * **For CPP, Change File, Template and create new file from first starting TVG**
* **Bugs fixed for checking files**
  * **To avoid processing errors**

  * **When print button clicked**
    * **The background color will turned white and the foreground color will be black**
    * **Need to click-checked for printing background, so that the marking highlight will be visible**
  * **Open browser for viewing html file**
    * **Defaulted to Safari for MacOs X, as the hyperlink can be click when save as pdf file**
    * **Defaulted to Edge in Windows, as the hyperlink can be click when save as pdf file**
    * **TAKE NOTE:**
      * **If the system has other default browser, it may open both browsers**
      * **In Chrome the hyperlink deactivated**
